Stake in Iron Bank Fixed Forex and earn the native token KP3R (vested, vKP3R)

# vKP3R

The KP3R mechanism is complex, and should be carefully understood before participating.

The systemâ€™s true native token is vKP3R, or vested KP3R, vKP3R earns protocol fees, these fees are dynamic based on supply and demand. Currently, these fees are 10.15% of TVL.

KP3R owners can choose to create a vesting lock, up to 4 years, with linear decay on the vKP3R contract

Once a lock has been created, LPs can stake in the distribution contracts, the distribution contract will distribute tokens every 7 days linearly.

Distribution tokens are rewarded based on your vesting lock. If the vesting lock is 1 years, you receive 1/4 tokens as vKP3R, which will become unlocked in 1 year. The remainder 3/4 tokens is distributed to the fee distribution contract.

vKP3R holders have two weekly claims, claim 1 is protocol accumulated fees (10.15% of TVL currently), and distributed KP3R from the distribution contract.

Simply put, the greater your time investment, the more disproportionate your reward.
